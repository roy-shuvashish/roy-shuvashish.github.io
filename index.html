<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>I'm a Master's student in the Civil Engineering program at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, advised by <a href="https://www.utc.edu/college-engineering-computer-science/profiles/civil-chemical-engineering/chemical-faculty/zcr277.php">Dr. Jejal Bathi</a>.
  My reseach work incorporates numerical simulation of flow hydrodynamics and water quality in various hydrologic scenarios for better watershed management. I am passionate about developing novel tools to support better watershed modeling, data analysis and visualization.  My current research interests are <b>Numerical Modeling</b>, <b>Hydrodynamics</b>, <b>Water Quality</b>, and <b>hydrologic modeling</b>. I am a member of <a href="http://ccvl.jhu.edu/">Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning (CCVL)</a>.</p>
<p>Before starting the master's program at the University of Tennessee, I completed my undergraduate education at Bangladesh Univerity of Engineering and Technology (BUET) where I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering degree in September 2015.</p>
